It's a straightforward project created in Python with the help of modules like Pyrogram and Beautiful Soup.
Install the prerequisites first from requirements.txt, then edit the code to add your api key, hash, and token.
Install the code on the platform of your choice. I included the Procfile because I used Heroku.
